# basic-hack-tools

A lightweight collection of tiny scripts and quick hacks. These are meant to be **simple utilities**, **learning examples**, or **handy helpers** you can run without ceremony.

Nothing fancy—just small tools that do one thing well.

## 📦 Contents

* **hack.sh** — a tiny Bash helper script with a couple of useful flags
* **LICENSE** — MIT license
* **.gitignore** — standard ignore file

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Clone or download the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/basic-hack-tools.git
   cd basic-hack-tools
   ```

2. Make the script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x hack.sh
   ```

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   ./hack.sh --help
   ```

## 🧪 Examples

Say something from the command line:

```bash
./hack.sh --say "Hello"
```

Print a timestamp:

```bash
./hack.sh --timestamp
```

## 🎯 Goals

* Keep scripts **short and readable**
* Avoid unnecessary dependencies
* Serve as quick references or starting points

If a script gets too big, it probably doesn’t belong here.
